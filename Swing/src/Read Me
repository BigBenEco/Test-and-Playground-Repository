Reading Assignment

I've been asked by many students "what do we read?"
GUI code is all over the Internet, many, many examples. 
The Java site has many tutorials on SWing, and GUI's. 

First will start with Swing classes and methods and then we'll show how JavaFX is changing some things. 
JFrame Common Methods

Container getContentPane()
void setDefaultCloseOperation(int operation)
setContentPane(Container contentPane)
void setTitle(String title)
void setMenuBar(MenuBar bm)
void setSize(int width, int height)
void pack()
setVisible(true)
JPanel Common Methods

JPanel()
JPanel(LayoutManager layout)
void add(Component c)
void paintComponent(Graphics g)
void repaint()
void getGraphics(Graphics g)
Graphics Common Methods

void drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
void drawOval(int x, int y, int width, int height)
void fillOval(int x, int y, int width, int height)
void drawPolygon(Polygon p)
void fillPolygon(Polygon p)
void drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height)
void fillRect(int x, int y, int width, int height)
Color getColor()
void setColor(Color c)
Layout Managers

java.awt.BorderLayout

The default layout for a JFrame.
Five areas are defined: north, east, south, west and center.
setLayout(new BorderLayout());
java.awt.FlowLayout

The default layout for a JPanel.
Components are added left to right, top to bottom, centered.
setLayout(new FlowLayout());
java.awt.BoxLayout

Components can be placed in either a horizontal or vertical arrangement.
setLayout(new BoxLayout(Container target, BoxLayout.X_AXIS));
setLayout(new BoxLayout(Container target, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));
java.awt.GridLayout

Components are place in a rectangular grid.
setLayout(new GridLayout(2,2));
Monday's In Class code

I will do a simple JButton with a actionListener.
SimpleButton.java
Also

One JFrame, two JPanels, one JButton, and one MouseListener
I will cover more on JPanels, JButtons and the frame on Wednesday. Plus the MouseListener.
Intro Code that I will start with: FrameMouseButton.zip
The zipped folder is a Netbeans project, the code is in the src folder. You can import the project into Eclipse or just use Netbeans.
SwingSet examples

Swingset2is a Swing program that Oracle made to demo the Swing capabilities. It used to come with the JDK, now it's a separate download. If you go to the Oracle download of JDK, below the JDK downloads there is a link for examples and demos. I downloaded jdk-8u66-windows-x64-demos.zip and it was in that folder under demos/jfc. There is a lot of example code for GUI's in the source folder. I'll show it on Monday.
The following is more example code. I've used most of this in past semesters, and some of it I will go over again this semester. If you get confused on any of the components listed like layouts, go to teh cod below that is an example.

All of the following code can be found in this zipped file (that way you don't have to download each individually).

Start with a simple JFrame with a button, the button outputs the ActionEvent as text.
