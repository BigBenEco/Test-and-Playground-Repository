	 * Ok here is how I think this will work.
	 * In the first function that follows, "drawBounds," its going to be told where the mouse is at, and it's going to be given an image of the current canvas.
	 * This function will then draw the bounding box. The box can be a simple dotted line, or use the variable "outlineThickness" to make a more accurate representation.
	 * You cold even just copy everything in the function "finalize" that way it draws exactly how the box will look like.
	 * When the function is done drawing, it will return the altered painting back to the canvas.
	 * 
	 * Like I said, both function below could be the same, they just need to draw.
	 * That's Canvas will handle the data, what is and is not saved, and so all this functions need to do is return the image they altered.
